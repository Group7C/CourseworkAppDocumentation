User Requirements
=================

Task interaction
----------------

``The user should be able to create, modify, collaborate, delete, and track tasks.``
Based on one-to-one and focus group interviews highlighting the need to manage/create tasks.

Communication
-------------
``Users should be able to use chat within the application or link to an external chosen chat tool.``
Derived from users clearly stating a need during group work for a central means of communication. This was consistent throughout the 3 different requirement gathering methods

Polling
-------

``Users should be able to vote within the group via polls.``
Identified as a need as interviewees often emphasised the use of diplomatic decision making within groups as important/common. This was heard most commonly through the one to one interviews and via focus groups.

Reporting
---------

``Users should be able to receive and generate periodic and final reports.``
Requested as a central function as it was frequently requested to hold group members accountable as lack of equal contribution was highlighted multiple times throughout all 3 requirement gathering methods.

Attendance Tracking
-------------------

``The user should be able to have personal and group attendance tracked.``
A core issue mentioned was an imbalance of attendance during group work, helping us identify this requirement. This was discussed through all the requirement gathering methods.

Visualization
-------------

``A user should be provided with visualizations for tasks, attendance, and contributions.``
During the design workshop, participants described a desire for this feature.

All-in-One Solution
-------------------

``The user should be given access to rapidly open agreed shared tools, such as Google Suite, via links within the program so it acts as a hub for the tools decided upon within individual groups/projects``
Interviewees flagged wasting time having to re-find links to shared document sharing applications or storage locations, stating having these linked in a central location within the project as being desired. This was mentioned throughout all the interview requirement gathering methods.

Rapid-Onboarding
----------------

``Users should be able to quickly and easily understand and use the majority of the application's functionality.``
This was mentioned in the one-to-one interview with the participants. Feedback suggested steep learning curves as a barrier to uptaking a new application to manage projects, so it was important to keep onboarding time to a minimum.

Account Management
------------------

``A user should be able to create and modify an account within the application.``
A core expectation expressed during data collection. This was mentioned throughout all the requirement gathering methods.

Collaboration
-------------

``Users should be able to create, join, and manage projects that contain groups.``
This was demanded in interviews for streamlined group handling. This was mentioned throughout all the requirement gathering methods.

Notifications
-------------

``Users should be able to receive notifications, which should be customizable regarding what and when.``
Feedback during interviews identified a desire for a notification system to help group members manage their input in a timely manner, with customizability to balance this functionality. This was mentioned in all the forms of requirement              gathering methods.

Customization
-------------

``Users should be able to customize their UI, with potential for point-based vanity purchases.``
A vanity feature suggested by interviewees in one-to-one and focus groups as desirable for engagement and satisfaction.
