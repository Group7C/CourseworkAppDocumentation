How To Set Up And Run The Project
=================================

Overview
--------

This section guides you through the steps to create a new project. Projects are central to the application, allowing teams to assign tasks, collaborate on shared tasks, monitor attendance, and track individual contributions efficiently.

Step-by-Step Guide
------------------

1. **Log in to your account**

   - Visit the ``login`` page.
   - Enter your ``email`` and ``password```.
   - If you don’t have an account yet, click on ``Sign Up``` to create one.

2. **Navigate to the Create Project screen**

   - After logging in, go to your account dashboard.
   - Click on the ``Project`` tab from the navigation bar.
   - Select ``Create New Project``.

3. **Fill in the project details**

   - **Project Name**: Enter a ``unique name`` for your project.
   - **Deadline**: Choose a due date for the overall project.
   - **Join Code**: Set a ``join code`` (6–10 characters, must include at least one number or special character).
   - **Notification Frequency** *(optional)*: Choose how often members should receive notifications.

4. **Add team members (optional)**

   - You may choose to ``add members``` now or share the join code later.
   - Members will need the **Project UID** and the **Join Code** to join.

5. **Submit and create**

   - Click the ``Create`` button.
   - If everything is valid, you will be redirected to the **Project Dashboard**.

6. **Share the project**

   - Share the Project UID and Join Code with your teammates so they can join.
   - They can enter this on their dashboard under **“Join Project”**.

7. **Start managing your project**

   From your Project Dashboard, you can now:
   - Create and assign tasks
   - Start tracking attendance
   - Get notifications according to the frequency that was set.
   - Visualise the deadline.
   - Set up communication channels
   - Generate reports

Tips and Best Practices
-----------------------

- Use clear and descriptive project names so team members can identify them easily. Make sure they are unique.
- Make sure your join code is strong and unique, but also easy to share securely.
- Assign roles early to define responsibilities.
- Keep the deadline realistic and track progress regularly.
- Don't share your details to others.
- Make sure to not share personal details.

Common Issues
-------------

- **"Join code invalid"**: Double-check the character length and that it contains a number or special character.
- **"Deadline is in the past"**: You must set a future date.
- **"Project name already exists"**: Use a unique name that hasn’t been used under your account.
