Tips and Best Practices
-----------------------

- Use clear and descriptive project names so team members can identify them easily. Make sure they are unique.
- Make sure your join code is strong and unique, but also easy to share securely.
- Assign roles early to define responsibilities.
- Keep the deadline realistic and track progress regularly.
- Don't share your details to others.
- Make sure to not share personal details.

Common Issues
-------------

- **"Join code invalid"**: Double-check the character length and that it contains a number or special character.
- **"Deadline is in the past"**: You must set a future date.
- **"Project name already exists"**: Use a unique name that hasn’t been used under your account.
